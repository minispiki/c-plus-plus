# My c++ work!
*I'm following a guide in a book*

**Any help will be appreciated!**

## Compiling
Go into a directory with ```cd``` (obv) and run ```g++ <cpp file> -o <bin name>.o```

*Note*
**IT WAS RECOMMENDED TO COMPILE WITHOUT A FILE EXTENSION SO IT DIDNT GET ADDED TO THE REPO
IF YOU HAVE AN OLDER COMMIT OF THE REPO RUN ```git clean -xf``` THEN PULL THE REPO.**
